       "'Mr S holds home emergency cover with Accredited. He made a claim after his boiler broke down. An engineer attended and found a fault with a circuit board (PCB). The cost of the repair exceeded the Â£300 policy limit by Â£46.27 and so Mr S paid the difference. Accredited confirmed that Mr S could buy some heaters and it would reimburse him up to Â£100 for this. A new PCB was ordered, but when an engineer attended to install it, they found that it was the wrong PCB. The correct PCB was then ordered. After this was installed, the engineer found another problem (with the thermistor). Accredited initially said Mr S would need to arrange his own repair at that point, as the policy limit had been reached. Though I understand Accredited did then order and install a new thermistor (which Mr S paid for). Mr S complained to Accredited about its handling of the claim. He was offered Â£200 compensation due to the issues with the initial repair and for Accreditedâ€™s lack of communication. Unhappy with this, Mr S brought a complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Our investigator upheld the complaint in part. She thought Accredited had been entitled to limit the payment under the policy to Â£300, and also thought the Â£200 compensation had been reasonable. However, as Mr S had shown that his electric bills had been higher for February and March 2023 compared to January 2023, she recommended that Accredited pay the difference. I issued a provisional decision on 15 April 2024. Hereâ€™s what I said: â€˜Iâ€™ve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whatâ€™s fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. \\uf0b7 Iâ€™ve only considered what has happened up to the date of Accreditedâ€™s final response letter of 24 April 2023. \\uf0b7 The policy says that Accredited will pay up to Â£300 for each claim for emergency work. The policy defines â€˜emergency workâ€™ as: â€˜The reasonable efforts a contractor makes to deal with an emergency during a visit to your home. This will be a temporary repair or, if it can be done at a similar cost, a permanent repair.â€™ \\uf0b7 The engineer made an error when they ordered the wrong PCB. I appreciate this would have been frustrating for Mr S as it caused a weekâ€™s delay. Though it seems the engineers only became aware that a thermistor was needed after the correct PCB was installed. \\uf0b7 As the costs of the new parts exceeded the policy limit of Â£300, I find it was reasonable for Accredited to ask Mr S to pay the difference. \\uf0b7 Mr S says he wasnâ€™t kept updated throughout the claim. I see that Mr S called Accredited several times whilst it was waiting for a quote for the repair. The quote was received three days after the engineer initially attended, and then Accredited updated Mr S soon after. I think Accreditedâ€™s handling of the claim was as Iâ€™d expect up to this point. However, after this Accredited didnâ€™t keep Mr S up to date. For example, I see he asked for an update on 8 March, but then had to call Accredited on 12 March when he didnâ€™t get a response. I think this was poor. \\uf0b7 Mr S has provided us with a copy of his energy bills. These show that he paid more for electricity after his boiler broke down than he did previously (as he was using electric heaters). Though itâ€™s also the case that he paid much less in gas. \\uf0b7 Our investigator recommended that Accredited pay the difference between the electricity bills in February and March 2023 compared to January 2023. However, I donâ€™t think that would be a fair outcome. Whilst Mr S is unhappy the boiler wasnâ€™t working for some time, thatâ€™s because the parts were on order, which was outside Accreditedâ€™s control. The only delay that Accredited was responsible for was between 28 February 2023 (when the wrong PCB was ordered) and 7 March 2023 (when the engineer realised the error and ordered the correct PCB). Mr S has confirmed that he bought the electric heaters on 5 March. So he only incurred additional electric costs for two days due to Accreditedâ€™s error, though some of this would have been offset by the saving he made on gas. \\uf0b7 Accredited offered Mr S Â£200 compensation. Taken in the round, I think this was reasonable compensation to recognise Accreditedâ€™s lack of communication and also compensates Mr S for the delay due to the wrong part being ordered, including the additional energy costs for two days.â€™ I asked both parties to provide any further comments they wished to make before I made a final decision. Accredited didnâ€™t provide any further comments by the deadline we gave. Mr S responded with the following main points: \\uf0b7 I hadnâ€™t considered that his wife had to stay at home for the repairs and lost out on earnings. \\uf0b7 He has had to pay out for two repairs, but hasnâ€™t been given a breakdown of this. \\uf0b7 He suggests that we consider experiencing the situation he has gone through first- hand.'"
